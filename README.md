Metrics
y_true: the skills missing in the job that are in the resume
y_predicted: the skills we predict are missing from the resume that are in the job

found: skills that were missing from the resume and we predicted
missed: skill we should have predicted that we didn't

unnecessary: skills that weren't missing from the resume but we still predicted / number of skills predicted
redudant: skills predicted that are already present / number of skills predicted
